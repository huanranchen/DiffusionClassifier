## Model Checkpoints


### VP Diffusion implementation (not recommended)


There are two version of our implementation. One is based on VP-SDE proposed by Song et al. (2021). This version is not recommended, and has been depreciated. For this, you need to download:

- [CIFAR10 unconditional diffusion model for DiffPure](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zfblaZd64Aye-FMpus85U5PLrpWKusO4/view). Put it into ./resources/checkpoints/DiffPure/32x32_diffusion.pth

- [CIFAR10 WideResNet-70-16-dropout](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mQoH6WbnfItphYKehWVniZmq9iixRn8L?usp=sharing)(discriminative classifier used in DiffPure). Put it into ./resources/checkpoints/models/WideResNet_70_16_dropout.pt

- Conditional diffusion model for diffusion classifier: We will share our checkpoints soon. Now you can train it by yourself.      

- [ImageNet unconditional diffusion model for DiffPure](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zfblaZd64Aye-FMpus85U5PLrpWKusO4/view). Put it into ./resources/checkpoints/DiffPure/256x256_diffusion_uncond.pt


### VE Diffusion implementation (not recommended)

Another is based on Karras et al. (2022), a.k.a. EDM. We strongly recommend you to use this implementation. For this, you need to download:

- [EDM checkpoints](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mQoH6WbnfItphYKehWVniZmq9iixRn8L?usp=sharing). Put it into ./resources/checkpoints/models/EDM/               
- [CIFAR10 WideResNet-70-16-dropout](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mQoH6WbnfItphYKehWVniZmq9iixRn8L?usp=sharing)(discriminative classifier used in DiffPure). Put it into ./resources/checkpoints/models/WideResNet_70_16_dropout.pt

## Usage

### Demos

We provide some demos in the root. We believe it's very clear and you will know how to use DC/RDC/LM after playing with the example code. Hence, we didn't add more explanation in this README.

**LM.py**: Likelihood Maximization with WRN-70-2.

**DCTK.py**: Diffusion Classifier on CIFAR10.

**RDCN+TK.py**: Robust Diffusion Classifier on CIFAR10.

### Experiments

All experiments codes are in *'./experiments/'*.

**DiffAttack.py**:  Attack DiffPure.         

**DiffusionClassifierN+T**: Multihead diffusion with likelihood maximization.

**DiffusionClassifierTK**: Off-the-shelf diffusion.

**DiffusionClassifierN+TK**: Off-the-shelf diffusion with likelihood maximization.

**DiffusionAsClassifier**: Depreciated. Test robustness of diffusion classifier (VP-SDE) under AutoAttack+BPDA/Lagrange/DirectDifferentiate

**DiffusionMaximizer**: Likelihood maximizer. A new diffusion purification method we proposed. See Sec 3.4 in our paper for detail. Could be combined with discriminative classifier.

**DirectAttack**: Direct differentiate through likelihood maximization.

**ObfuscatedGradient**: Measure the cosine similarity between the gradient of diffusion classifier and DiffPure. See Sec 4.4 in our paper for detail.

**OptimalDiffusionClassifier**: See Sec 3.3 for detail.

**stadv**: Measure the robustness under STAdv attack.

**cifar100**: Experiment on cifar100
